<b>Alexander Bonus</b>, Founding Director of <i><a href="http://www.probonomusic.net" target="_blank">The Forces of Virtue</a></i> is one of the few early music conductors today who maintains an active career as a performer.

Born in 1975, Mr. Bonus founded <i>The Forces of Virtue</i> in 2003 to perform some of the greatest unknown music of the Renaissance and Baroque eras. Through the ensemble's programs, he strives to relate these historic creations to our contemporary life and society. Alex has lectured at the Eastman School of Music, Northwestern University, DePaul University, Roosevelt University, the Newberry Library, and Chicago Opera Theater. He holds MM and BM degrees from the Eastman School of Music, where he studied performance, conducting, and early music.
