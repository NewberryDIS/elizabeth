Mezzo-soprano <b>Elizabeth Grizzell</b> has performed as a soloist with ensembles both in the Midwest and abroad, and was recently praised by the Chicago Tribune: "Elizabeth Grizzell displayed a beautifully shaded mezzo." In England, she has appeared with the Tunbridge Wells Opera, the Marlow Choral Society, and the Wooburn Singers. In Chicago, she has performed and recorded the role of Apprentice in Wagner's <i>Die Meistersinger</i> with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus with the late Sir Georg Solti conducting. She is a member of the newly-formed Chicago Symphony Singers. Especially fond of oratorio, her performances have included Mendelssohn's <i>Elijah</i>, Mozart's <i>Requiem</i>, and Handel's <i>Susannah</i>. Betsy records regularly as a soloist with Richard Proulx's Cathedral Singers, and will perform this year with Music of the Baroque.
