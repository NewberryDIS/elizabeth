<b>The Forces of Virtue Ensemble</b>
<p>
The new early music ensemble <i>The Forces of Virtue</i> displays the wealth of important music from the Renaissance and the Baroque, with an emphasis on neglected sacred and dramatic compositions of the 15th through 18th Centuries. <i>The Forces of Virtue</i>, founded in 2003 by director Alexander Bonus, structures its programs to reflect contemporary life, issues, and culture, proving that the great art of the past can have profound relevance to modern society.
<p>
The name of the ensemble is taken from an opera by Baroque composer Reinhard Keiser, which embodies the tenets of <i>The Forces of Virtue</i>; that art can be a force for good and a catalyst for positive change, educating audiences, enriching lives, creating stronger communities, while stimulating thought and action.
<p>
In January 2003, the Forces of Virtue made their debut with <i>A Concert for Peace</i>, a thematic program of war and peace music from the Renaissance. Utilizing over 30 professional singers and instrumentalists from the Chicago area, the two benefit performances of <i>A Concert for Peace</i> raised one thousand dollars for the charity Doctors Without Borders.  Its second program, <i>Handel's Muse</i>, presented the modern world premieres of opera excerpts from <i>Claudius</i> (1703) and <i>la Forza della Virtï¿½</i> (1700) by Keiser, and <i>Cleopatra</i> (1704) by Johann Mattheson.
<p>
Along with various programs in 2004, future projects include the modern world premiere of <i>Missa Integra</i> (c. 1723) by Antonio Caldara; an important sacred work for large orchestra and choir composed by an unduly neglected Baroque composer who had a significant influence on the music of J.S. Bach.
