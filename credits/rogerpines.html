The repertoire of <b>Roger Pines</b> (<i>countertenor</i>) has ranged in America from Primo Pastore in Monteverdi's <i>Orfeo</i> (The Dallas Opera) and the alto solos of Bach's <i>Magnificat</i> (Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra) to Handel's <i>Messiah</i> (Chicago) and Oberon in Britten's <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> (The Opera of the University of Wisconsin-Madison). His concert activities have also included appearances with San Diego's Ensemble Nota Bene, of which he was a founding member; the Dallas Bach Society; the vocal ensemble of the Newberry Consort; and a recital at Madison's Elvehjem Museum of Art. He will sing the <i>Messiah</i> alto solos at the University of Chicago's Rockefeller Chapel for the second consecutive year in December 2003.
<p>
Mr. Pines changed from tenor to countertenor after substituting on 24 hours' notice for an ailing countertenor for a concert at Munich's Herkules-Saal by the renowned Clemencic Consort. He later performed a variety of Renaissance and Baroque works with that group in Vienna, Florence, and Venice. His European credits also include two rarely heard Baroque operas, Draghi's <i>La vita nella morte</i> and Emperor Leopold II's <i>Il lutto dell'universo</i>, with Vienna's Spectaculum festival, as well as concerts with Cappella Academica Wien at Vienna's Musikverein; with the Paul-Hofhaymer Ensemble in Salzburg; and with Musica Antiqua Wien in Vienna and Belgrade.
