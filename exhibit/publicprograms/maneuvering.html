<font class="bioshdr">Maneuvering by Mail: Elizabeth's Correspondence with James VI of Scotland and the Question of the Succession to Elizabeth's Throne</font><br>
<p>
Saturday, December 13, 11:00 a.m.<br>
The Newberry Library 
<p>
<i>Speaker: Janel Mueller, University of Chicago</i><br>
For a childless queen in a system defined as hereditary monarchy, the toughest problem was to ensure, in an orderly fashion, a successor to her own reign. Dr. Mueller will examine the fascinating correspondence Elizabeth initiated in the 1580s with James VI of Scotland. The son of Mary Queen of Scots was induced to accept his mother's execution on Elizabeth's command, and for decades sought to elicit a promise from Elizabeth that he would be named her heir and unite the thrones of England and Scotland.
