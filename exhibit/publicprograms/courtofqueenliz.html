<p>
Experience a musical homage fit for Queen Elizabeth I herself. The "Queen of Love and Beauty" was a goddess to her subjects, and she still has the power to charm and fascinate. On the 400th anniversary of her death, The Newberry Consort features a true English Consort of flute, violin, viols, cittern, lute, bandora, and voices performing music by William Byrd, Thomas Morley, John Dowland, and others. Performers include soprano Ellen Hargis, countertenor Drew Minter, lutenist Jacob Heringman, and more.
