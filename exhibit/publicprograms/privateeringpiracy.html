<i>Speaker: Robert C. Ritchie, The Huntington Library</i><br> 
During the reign of Elizabeth I, English sea power entered a new era, as a hitherto secondary maritime power suddenly emerged as a significant naval power. The names of Sir Francis Drake, Sir John Hawkins and others have been celebrated since the reign of Elizabeth to the present day. However, to their enemies and some of their friends, these seadogs could never escape the charge of being pirates rather than national heroes. This lecture will consider these and other aspects of a famous episode in European maritime expansion.
