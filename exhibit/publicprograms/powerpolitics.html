<font class="bioshdr">Power Politics and Sexual Intrigues around the Virgin Queen: Elizabeth I and her Courtships</font>
<p>
Saturday, October 4, 11:00 a.m.<br>
The Newberry Library 
<p>
<i>Speaker: Carole Levin, University of Nebraska </i><br>
Elizabeth I was only 25 when she became queen, and from the beginning of her reign claimed that, despite the wishes of her parliaments and councilors, she preferred to remain a virgin. It is obvious, however, that she loved being courted and receiving marriage proposals. In this slide lecture, Dr. Levin will discuss a variety of official courtships of Elizabeth by foreign royalty and examine her relationship with her "favorite" Robert Dudley. Despite all the rumors and potential scandals, Elizabeth survived the power politics and sexual intrigues as "one mistress, with no master."
