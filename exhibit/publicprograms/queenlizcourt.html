<p>
Saturday, November 22, 11:00 a.m.<br>
The Newberry Library
<p>
<i>Speaker: David Starkey, Cambridge University </i><br>
The author of <i>Elizabeth: The Struggle for the Throne</i> develops the theme of his bestselling biography of the young Elizabeth with a more general analysis of the role of the Queen's personality and personal power in government. He also will draw upon his newest book, <i>Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII</i>, to show how many of the women of the Tudor court who shaped the future queen were clever, well-educated, brilliantly manipulative and powerfully influential.
<p> 
Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII <i>will be available for purchase in the Newberry Library Bookstore. A book signing will follow the talk</i>. 
<p>
<i>Admission is free. No reservation required. This talk is co-sponsored by the Society for Court Studies.</i>
