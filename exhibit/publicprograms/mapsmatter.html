<p>
Thursday, October 23, 6:00 p.m.<br>
The Newberry Library 
<p>
<i>Speaker: Peter Barber, The British Library </i><br>
Maps played a number of important roles in Elizabethan England and some decision-makers were passionate about them. Leading scholars, soldiers, and administrators patronized mapmakers-and even created maps. But what about Elizabeth I? She was frequently portrayed with maps and globes. This lecture will investigate whether she was genuinely interested or whether it was what today would be called "spin." Should Elizabeth, for her own sake, have been more interested?
