Thomas Cranmer (p. 5)
<blockquote>
All princely graces . . .<br>
Shall still be doubled on her.  Truth shall nurse her,<br>
Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her.<br>
She shall be loved and feared.  Her own shall bless her;<br>
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,<br>
And hang their heads with sorrow.   Good grows with her.<br>
In her days every man shall eat in safety<br>
Under his own vine what he plants, and sing<br>
The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours.<br>
God shall be truly known, and those about her<br>
From her shall read the perfect ways of honour
</blockquote>
From William Shakespeare, <u>Henry VIII</u>, 5.4.25-37, in <u>The Norton Shakespeare</u>, ed. Stephen Greenblatt et al. (New York, Norton, 1997).
