<b>Transcription of Tilbury speech</b>
<p>
At the army encampment near the town of Tilbury, Elizabeth delivered a legendary speech on August 9, 1588, vowing to die with her troops in defense of England. 
<p>
Different versions of the speech survive, but the most famous version probably reflects the words as Elizabeth wanted her people to remember them:
<p>
"My loving people: I have been persuaded by some, that are careful of my safety, to take heed how I committed my self to armed multitudes for fear of treachery.  But I tell you, that I would not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people.  Let tyrants fear.  I have so behaved my self, that under god I have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard in the loyal harts and goodwill of my subjects. Wherefore I am come among you at this time, [not] for my recreation and pleasure, [but] being resolved in the midst and heat of the battle to live and die amongst you all, to lay down for my god, and for my kingdom and for my people mine honor and my blood run in the dust.  I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too,  and take foul scorn that Parma or any prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.
<p>
"To the which rather than any dishonor shall grow by me, I myself will venture my blood, myself will be your general, judge and rewarder of your virtue in the field.  I know that already for your forwardness you have deserved rewards and crowns and I assure you in the word of a prince you shall not fail of them.  In the mean time my Lieutenant General [the Earl of Leicester] shall be in my steed, than whom never prince commanded a more noble or worthy subject. Not doubting but by your concord in the camp and valor in the field and your obedience to my self and my general, we shall shortly have a famous victory over this enemy of my god and of my kingdom.
<p>
Queen Elizabeth to the Troops at Tilbury, August 9, 1588<br>
