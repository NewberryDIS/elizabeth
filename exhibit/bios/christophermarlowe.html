Christopher Marlowe (1564-1593)was the leading playwright of the English stage in the years immediately before the emergence of Shakespeare. Marlowe was educated at Cambridge, where he dabbled in theological heresies and began a career as a double agent infiltrating circles of Catholic dissent. Between 1587 and 1593 he stunned London stage audiences with spectacular dramas, including <i>Tamburlaine</i>, <i>Doctor Faustus</i>, <i>The Jew of Malta</i>, <i>Edward II</i>, and <i>The Massacre at Paris</i>. He was arrested for counterfeiting, and subsequently released, only to be arrested again on suspicion of a range of behaviors including heresy and homosexuality. While under investigation, Marlowe was murdered. The killing was probably the result of a violent quarrel, but perhaps a political assassination. Shakespeare's Elizabethan plays are saturated with verbal echoes of Marlowe's poetry.
