Pius V (1504-1572) became Pope in 1566. In addition to his excommunication of Elizabeth, he established the Index of Forbidden Books, and supported the rulers of Spain and Italy in their military struggle against the Islamic states of the Mediterranean, led by Turkey. He was canonized as a saint in 1712.
