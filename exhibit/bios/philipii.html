Philip II of Spain (1566-1598) launched the fearsome Spanish Armada against Elizabeth in 1588. Philip was the son of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and inherited his father's realms in Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, and America. In 1554 Philip married Mary I of England in an attempt to restore the island to the Spanish sphere of influence. After Mary's death, he suggested marriage to Elizabeth, but Philip did not show much real interest in the match.
