<p>
William Cecil, Lord Burgley (1520-1598) was Elizabeth's chief minister throughout most of her reign. Educated at Cambridge, Cecil was a member of the council of Edward VI. From her first day as queen, Elizabeth made him part of her inner circle and relied on him above all for advice. He held the position of principal or first secretary, which put him in charge of carrying out the queen's policies. Later he was Lord Treasurer. When age overcame Burghley, he advanced his younger son Robert Cecil (1563-1612) as Elizabeth's principal secretary.
