<p>
Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk (1473-1554) was one of the most powerful figures during the reign of Henry VIII. When Henry went to war in France in 1513, Howard won a great victory over an invading Scots army at Flodden, where the Scottish king was killed. He became Duke of Norfolk when his father died in 1524. Two of his nieces became Henry's wives-first Anne Boleyn in 1533 and then Catherine Howard in 1540. Both, however were executed. Likewise, Norfolk's eldest son Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, the renowned poet, was executed for treason in 1547. Norfolk himself escaped execution only because Henry died before the warrant could be carried out.
