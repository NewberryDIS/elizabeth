<p>
Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder (1503-1542) was a favorite companion of Henry VIII and the greatest poet of Henry's court. He likely conducted a romance with Anne Boleyn before Henry himself became interested in her. Wyatt was a political ally of Henry's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, and served as ambassador to the Holy Roman Emperor. He came under suspicion when Cromwell fell from power, and was imprisoned by Henry in the period immediately before his death.

His son Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger (1521-1554) led a rebellion against Mary I that nearly toppled her from the throne. Wyatt the younger was executed in April, 1554.
