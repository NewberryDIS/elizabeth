Fran�ois Hercule, duke of Alen�on (1554-1584) was the brother of three kings of France, Fran�ois II, Charles IX, and Henri III. From 1566 to 1576 he was Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, and in 1576 became Duke of Anjou. He is usually called Alen�on to avoid confusion with his older brother Henri, who also was Duke of Anjou before becoming king. Alen�on visited England in 1579 and again in 1582-83 in his attempts to marry Elizabeth.
