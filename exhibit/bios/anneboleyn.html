Anne Boleyn (1507-1536) was the niece of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk. She had received a fine education in literature and music while a lady in waiting to Queen Claude of France, the wife of the great Franï¿½ois I. After a six-year liaison, Anne married Henry VIII on January 25, 1533. As queen, she was a patron of Protestant religious reform, and a strong supporter of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. She was executed on trumped-up charges of adultery on May 19, 1536. Eleven days later, Henry married his third wife, Jane Seymour.
