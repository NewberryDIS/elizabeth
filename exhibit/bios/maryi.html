Mary I (1516-1558) was the daughter of Henry VIII and his first wife, Katharine of Aragon. At age sixteen, Mary found herself demoted from her position as heir to the throne in favor of her infant sister Elizabeth, and then in favor of her brother Edward. Upon Edward's death in 1553, the supporters of Lady Jane Grey proclaimed that both Mary and Elizabeth were bastards, but the kingdom remained loyal to the children of Henry VIII and Mary became queen. A devout Catholic, she restored the religion of her youth and married her mother's kinsman Philip II, King of Spain. In her persecutions of Protestants, more than three hundred people were burned at the stake, earning her the nickname "Bloody Mary." She imprisoned Elizabeth in the Tower of London, but never gave the order for Elizabeth's execution or murder.
