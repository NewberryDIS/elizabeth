Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was a leading legal figure in the government of Elizabeth, who, during the reign of her successor James I became Lord Chancellor. Bacon's philosophical writings brought him international renown, and has earned him the reputation of being one of the founders of modern scientific thinking. Bacon was the son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, who as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal delivered many of Elizabeth's speeches to Parliament.
