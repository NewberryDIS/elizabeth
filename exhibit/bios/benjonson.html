Ben Jonson (1572-1637) was the leading dramatist and poet among those a decade younger than Shakespeare. Indeed, Shakespeare was an actor in at least one of Jonson's plays, and Jonson wrote a moving epitaph for the First Folio of Shakepeare's works. Jonson wrote powerful tragedies, but his genius was for comedy, notably <i>Volpone</i> (1606), <i>The Alchemist</i> (1610), and <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> (1614). Jonson also revolutionized the form of the court masque, which were splendid entertainments on mythological themes performed for the Stuart kings.
