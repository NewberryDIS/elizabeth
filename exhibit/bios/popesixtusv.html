Sixtus V (1520-1590) became Pope in 1585. In addition to his support for the Armada against England, he attempted to influence the outcome of the religious civil wars in France. The Protestant prince Henri of Navarre achieved military victory, but could not subdue Paris until he converted to Catholicism (supposedly saying "Paris is worth a mass"). Sixtus then accepted him as King Henri IV.
