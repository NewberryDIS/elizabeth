Thomas Heywood (1574-1641) was a prolific writer during the early seventeenth century. His play about Elizabeth's early life, called <i>If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody</i> was very popular, and later he wrote several prose works about her, including <i>England's Elizabeth</i>. His most famous play is <i>A Woman Killed With Kindness</i>, which takes its title from a line in Shakespeare's <i>Taming of a Shrew</i>.
