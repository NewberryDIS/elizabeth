Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton (1540-1614) was the second son of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, whom Henry VIII had executed for treason in 1547, and the younger brother of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, whom Elizabeth executed for treason in 1572. It is no surprise, therefore, that Elizabeth never completely trusted him. Ultimately, Northampton's loyalty to Mary Queen of Scots won him a seat on the Privy Council in the reign of Elizabeth's successor James I, Mary's son.
