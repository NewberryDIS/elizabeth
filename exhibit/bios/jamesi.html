James I of England and VI of Scotland (1566-1625) succeeded Elizabeth in 1603 as monarch of England. James was the son of Mary Queen of Scots and became king of Scotland as an infant when his mother fled to England. James carefully cultivated Elizabeth in hopes of succeeding to the English throne. As the first ruler of both England and Scotland, he united the island into a single realm of Great Britain.
