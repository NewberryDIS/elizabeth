Henry VIII (1491-1547) was the younger son of Henry VII, who had captured the throne from Richard III at the battle of Bosworth, and Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV. Henry was seventeen years old when he became king in 1509. One of his first decisions was to marry Katharine of Aragon, daughter of the Spanish rulers Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, and the widow of his older brother Arthur. In 1533 Henry had his marriage to Katharine annulled, and married Anne Boleyn, who shortly thereafter gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth.
