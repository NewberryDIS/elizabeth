Sir Walter Raleigh (1554-1618) (also spelled Ralegh) was a chief courtier and soldier of Elizabeth's court, and became famous for the range of his accomplishments. As Captain of the Queen's Guard, Raleigh was entrusted with Elizabeth's personal safety. As sponsor of the "Virginia" colony, he founded the first English settlement in North America. As a poet, he wrote several lyrics that rival the accomplishments of Marlowe and Donne. As a prisoner in the Tower of London under James I, he wrote a <i>History of the World</i> that remains astonishing in its scope and learning. Raleigh was executed by James in 1618.
